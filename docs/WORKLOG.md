# Worklog

What we are doing now, and a dated log of what is done. Updated and pushed
after every step. For the full history, decisions and recovery guide see
[PROJECT_LOG.md](PROJECT_LOG.md).

## Now

**Current task:** write the M2 plan (the `scd` watcher) for approval. No M2
code until the plan is approved.

- [x] M1 follow-up fix 1 (read race). `c720f22`
- [x] M1 follow-up fix 2 (restore order). `ec15ece`
- [x] Full check after both fixes: gofmt, vet, tests as user and as root,
      static build, root smoke PASS.
- [ ] Independent review of the two fixes (running: three reviewers
      (concurrency, security, regressions), each finding re-checked by two
      skeptics).
- [ ] Draft the M2 plan (running: three independent drafts from different
      angles, two judges, a synthesis, a critic against the research, the
      decisions and CLAUDE.md). Then publish as `docs/M2_PLAN.md` for
      approval.
- [ ] Next-steps roadmap (running in parallel: three advisors on execution,
      safety and testing, and milestone order; a synthesis and a critic). Then
      publish as `docs/NEXT_STEPS.md`.

**Decisions already made for M2** (2026-09-27, "go with your picks"):

1. Scope: all of `/etc` minus the exclude list; the tiers only decide how
   loudly to alert.
2. Symlinks: supported in M2 (needed for systemd enable, disable and mask).
3. Deleted and newly created files: recorded in history.
4. SSH host private keys: fingerprint, mode and owner only, no content.
5. Outside `/etc`: `authorized_keys` files and `/boot/grub`; not whole
   `.ssh` folders (they hold private keys).
6. The two M1 fixes go first, as a small M1 follow-up.

## Log

### 2026-09-27

- **M1 built and accepted.** Store, CLI, Makefile, smoke test; acceptance run
  passed as root. Commits `690ab95` to `020c205`.
- **Visual docs.** System map, narrated films; fixed two playback bugs.
  `847e14a`, `994f16c`.
- **Published.** README, branch `main`, public repo
  https://github.com/NikhilSah27/SmartConfig, GitHub Pages site
  https://nikhilsah27.github.io/SmartConfig/. `f5d81bc`.
- **Full check from a fresh clone:** tests, vet, gofmt clean, static binary,
  root smoke PASS, all Pages URLs load.
- **Project log and recovery guide.** `2980474`.
- **Exploratory test of `sc`:** 35 real-world checks (bad inputs, setuid
  restore, deleted files, immutable files, corrupt blobs, 8 parallel
  snapshots). No bugs; two test-script mistakes corrected.
- **M2 research:** what the watcher must watch, ignore and beware of,
  researched on this VM by 16 agents, key claims re-tested.
  [M2_WATCHLIST.md](M2_WATCHLIST.md), `9df9dd3`.
- **logrotate and sc's temp files:** confirmed logrotate reads
  `.<name>.sc-tmp-*` in `/etc/logrotate.d`; tested `~`, `.dpkg-tmp` and
  `.swp` suffixes and none avoids it. Impact is one skipped duplicate stanza
  if logrotate runs during a restore's few milliseconds. Left as is.
- **M1 fix 1:** `ReadWithMeta` now opens with `O_NOFOLLOW|O_NONBLOCK` and
  requires the opened file to be the one lstat saw. New test reproduces a
  swapped file, a symlink and a FIFO; it fails on the old code (read the
  wrong file, followed the symlink, blocked on the FIFO). `c720f22`.
- **M1 fix 2:** `store.Restore` now inserts its row, renames the file while
  holding the write lock, then commits (rolled back if the write fails). A
  watcher that sees the rename and takes the lock finds the restore row
  instead of an unexplained change. Tests pause inside the restore to prove
  it and fail on the old order. `ec15ece`.
- **Full check after both fixes:** gofmt, vet, all tests as user and as root,
  static build, `sudo ./scripts/smoke.sh` PASS, `/etc/hosts` unchanged.
