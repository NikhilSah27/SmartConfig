# Worklog

What we are doing now, and a dated log of what is done. Updated and pushed
after every step. For the full history, decisions and recovery guide see
[PROJECT_LOG.md](PROJECT_LOG.md).

## Now

**Current task:** M1 follow-up. Fix the two issues the M2 research found in
the M1 code, before any M2 work starts.

- [x] Fix 1: `fsutil.ReadWithMeta` must refuse a file swapped between lstat
      and open (symlink or FIFO race). Done in `c720f22`.
- [ ] Fix 2: `store.Restore` renames the file before it records its row, so a
      watcher sees an unexplained change for 10-60 ms. Make the restore row and
      the rename one locked step.
- [ ] Re-run the full check (tests, vet, gofmt, static build, root smoke).

**Next:** write the M2 plan (the `scd` watcher) for approval. No M2 code
until the plan is approved.

**Decisions already made for M2** (2026-09-27, "go with your picks"):

1. Scope: all of `/etc` minus the exclude list; the tiers only decide how
   loudly to alert.
2. Symlinks: supported in M2 (needed for systemd enable, disable and mask).
3. Deleted and newly created files: recorded in history.
4. SSH host private keys: fingerprint, mode and owner only, no content.
5. Outside `/etc`: `authorized_keys` files and `/boot/grub`; not whole
   `.ssh` folders (they hold private keys).
6. The two M1 fixes go first, as a small M1 follow-up.

## Log

### 2026-09-27

- **M1 built and accepted.** Store, CLI, Makefile, smoke test; acceptance run
  passed as root. Commits `690ab95` to `020c205`.
- **Visual docs.** System map, narrated films; fixed two playback bugs.
  `847e14a`, `994f16c`.
- **Published.** README, branch `main`, public repo
  https://github.com/NikhilSah27/SmartConfig, GitHub Pages site
  https://nikhilsah27.github.io/SmartConfig/. `f5d81bc`.
- **Full check from a fresh clone:** tests, vet, gofmt clean, static binary,
  root smoke PASS, all Pages URLs load.
- **Project log and recovery guide.** `2980474`.
- **Exploratory test of `sc`:** 35 real-world checks (bad inputs, setuid
  restore, deleted files, immutable files, corrupt blobs, 8 parallel
  snapshots). No bugs; two test-script mistakes corrected.
- **M2 research:** what the watcher must watch, ignore and beware of,
  researched on this VM by 16 agents, key claims re-tested.
  [M2_WATCHLIST.md](M2_WATCHLIST.md), `9df9dd3`.
- **logrotate and sc's temp files:** confirmed logrotate reads
  `.<name>.sc-tmp-*` in `/etc/logrotate.d`; tested `~`, `.dpkg-tmp` and
  `.swp` suffixes and none avoids it. Impact is one skipped duplicate stanza
  if logrotate runs during a restore's few milliseconds. Left as is.
- **M1 fix 1:** `ReadWithMeta` now opens with `O_NOFOLLOW|O_NONBLOCK` and
  requires the opened file to be the one lstat saw. New test reproduces a
  swapped file, a symlink and a FIFO; it fails on the old code (read the
  wrong file, followed the symlink, blocked on the FIFO). `c720f22`.
